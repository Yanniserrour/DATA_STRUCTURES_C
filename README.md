# Data Structures in C 🚀

This repository is dedicated to the implementation and study of fundamental **Data Structures** using the C programming language.

## 📝 Overview

C is a **statically-typed, middle-level language** that provides direct access to memory through pointers. This makes it the ideal language for learning how data structures work under the hood, as it requires manual memory management and precise logic.

## 🛠 Project Structure

The implementations are categorized into two main types of data structures:

### 1. Linear Data Structures
*Elements are arranged in a sequential manner, where each element is connected to its previous and next adjacent elements.*

* **Arrays:**
    * **1D Arrays:** Static and dynamic vectors.
    * **2D Arrays:** Matrices and grids.
* **Linked Lists:**
    * **Singly Linked List:** Forward navigation using nodes.
    * **Doubly Linked List:** Bi-directional navigation.
    * **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the head.
* **Stacks:** LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) structures.
* **Queues:** FIFO (First-In, First-Out) structures.

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
*Elements are arranged in a hierarchical or interconnected way, rather than sequentially.*

* **Trees:** (e.g., Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees) for hierarchical data.
* **Graphs:** Representing complex networks using Adjacency Lists or Matrices.
* **Hash Tables:** Efficient data retrieval using key-value mapping and hash functions.

## 💻 Technical Concepts Covered

To build these structures, this project explores:
* **Pointers & Memory Addresses:** Navigating the RAM directly.
* **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Using `malloc()`, `calloc()`, and `free()`.
* **Structs:** Defining custom data types for nodes and containers.
* **Complexity:** Understanding Time ($O(n)$) and Space complexity.

## 📚 Learning Objectives
* Master pointer arithmetic.
* Understand the trade-offs between different data storage methods.
* Write memory-efficient and optimized C code.
